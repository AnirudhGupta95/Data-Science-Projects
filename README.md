This repository contains project on Total Credit Card Spending prediction of individuals.
Since we have documented our efforts we are not describing much here.
We created many models for the problem but found XG Boost regressor to be achieving the best results thus we have uploaded only the file containing that model.
For further description please check the documentation.
